### What are these properties/functions with an `internal_` prefix?

There is some metadata and functionality that solid-client exposes or attaches to the data structures it
returns, that are for internal use and/or allows your editor to warn you when you are passing the
wrong type of data to its functions. These are _not_ intended for direct access, and they might
change without warning in newer versions.

For each of these pieces of data, solid-client exposes non-internal functions such as
[`getContentType`](./api/modules/_resource_resource_.md#getcontenttype) to access them and that
_are_ part of the officially supported API, and hence can be relied upon not to break without
warning.

### How can my app work with data from other apps?

Having multiple apps working with the same data is called interoperability, a concept at the core of the Solid philosophy.
One step in this direction is to use well-known, shared vocabularies to describe data. Simply put, if all the apps
refer to a person as a [foaf:Person](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person), then they can all work using the same profile
documents.

Many vocabularies exist today, to describe many aspects of data. To help you use common, well-known vocabularies, you
can have a look at [our vocabulary artifacts](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-common-vocab-rdf), which are constants
you can import so that you don't have to manually look up and type in the correct IRI for common terms.
